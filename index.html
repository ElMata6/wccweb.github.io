		 Hello, my name is Larry. If you are reading this it is because you are currently visiting my website, welcome. This page is goin to include design elements that I find interesting to incorporate onto this website and various music playlists. These playlist will consist of 10 songs and will be posted every Thursday at 4 p.m.. One of my favorite hobbies is listening to music so I will share that interest onto this website.
